# R and RStudio: Information, Tutorials, and Workshops

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language and a free software environment to write and execute the R language. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an Integrated Development Environment that provides free and open\-source tools for R.
